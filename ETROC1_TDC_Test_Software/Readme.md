## 1. This python script is used for testing the ETROC1 TDC chip
  - **command\_interpret.py** is a class for sockect communication
  - **kc705\_mig\_control.py** includes all kinds of function such as I2C write/read, DDR3 data storage, Ethernet communication.
## 2. Hardware platform
  - The FPGA is Xilinx KC705 EVB and the FPGA socket address is 192.168.2.x, The x is configurable via switch (SW11, Pin1 and Pin2) and its value ranges from 0 to 3 and the port number is fixed to 1024. [Schematic of KC705 EVB](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/boards_and_kits/kc705_Schematic_xtp132_rev1_1.pdf)
```verilog
hostname = '192.168.2.3'			#FPGA IP address
port = 1024					#port number
```
  - The python script is running on the Windows operating system.
  - Between the PC and KC705 EVB is connected by Ethernet cable. 
  - I2C interface mapping is shown as below figure.

## 3. Software version
  - Firmware compliled on Vivado 2016.2 version
  - Python version: **python3.7.5** and The python scripts are all executed on **Atom IDE** with terminal package. You can choose other IDE for python according to your habits.
  - Ethernet communication speed is 1Gbps, Please make sure the Ethernet cable can meet the requirements.
## 4. FPGA GTX reference clock configuration
  - The GTX reference clock is generated by Si5338 clock generator and its frequency is **160 MHz**. 
  - The Si5338 EVB is configured by ClockBuilder Pro v.2.37.0.1 [ClockBuilder Pro download link](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/clockbuilder-pro-software)
