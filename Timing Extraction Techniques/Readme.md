### 1. This python script is used to simulate timing extraction. The are four methods to extracte arrival time of pulse leading edge as below:
  - Constant fraction discrimination (CFD).
  - Single threshold.
  - Multiple threshold.
  - Pulse waveform sampling.
### 2. Pre-Amplifier transfer function
$$f(s) = s+1$$
